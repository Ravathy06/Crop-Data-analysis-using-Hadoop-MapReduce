# Crop-Data-analysis-using-Hadoop-MapReduce



This project aims to recommend the appropriate crop to sow in a specific season based on historical data analysis. Using Hadoop MapReduce with crop yield and rainfall datasets, maximum and minimum crop yields, average crop production, and average temperature and rainfall requirements can be obtained for six distinct seasons in a particular state. The framework can help policymakers and farmers make informed decisions.
